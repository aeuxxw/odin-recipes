<h2> Description </h2>
<p>These slow cooker Asian zing chicken noodles are amazing—so much flavor with so little effort. Chicken thighs, slow-cooked in sweet spicy chili-soy-ginger zing sauce, are shredded and tossed with quick-cooking fresh lo mein noodles. If your comfort food tends to the spicy, this is for you.</p>

<li>1 bunch green onions, sliced, for garnish</li>
</ul>
<h3> Steps </h3>
